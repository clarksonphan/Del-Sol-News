<h1>Colonizing Mars Will Take Decades </h1>

    <p>
        2020 marks a new tide for space exploration, but these advances alone cannot colonize Mars. 
        
        With 10 million people watching live on Saturday, May 30, SpaceX successfully launched two astronauts — 
        NASA fliers Robert Behnken and Doug Hurley — into low Earth orbit in the Crew Dragon Demo-2. Since 2011, 
        the United States has relied on Russia for human spaceflight, but with SpaceX’s launch, the U.S. once again 
        can proudly transport astronauts to low Earth orbit. 
        
        NASA also has plans to launch the Mars Persistence Rover in July 2020, which will “search for signs of habitable 
        conditions on Mars in the ancient past and for signs of past microbial life itself” (“Overview”, n.d.). These 
        results have the potential to determine whether Mars as a planet is truly habitable 
        
        With all these explorations and successes, it can appear that moving to Mars maybe a couple of years away. 
        Unfortunately, the differences between Earth and Mars create complicated, unprecedented issues. 
        
        While Earth’s atmosphere consists of 78 percent nitrogen and 28 percent oxygen, Mars contains 95 percent 
        carbon dioxide, 3 percent nitrogen, and only 0.2 percent oxygen. Its atmosphere is also very thin (1 percent of 
        Earth’s atmosphere), creating temperatures as low as minus 80℃. Not only will it be impossible to breathe, but 
        we’ll freeze to death as well. 
        
        Also, zero gravity in space is known to decrease bone and muscle mass in astronauts, and since Mars has 38 
        percent the surface gravity of Earth, there is no telling how it may affect people’s health upon settlement.
        
        Not to mention, Mars has no global magnetic field, meaning it is heavily exposed to sunlight radiation. 
        
        The Curiosity Mars rover “revealed that the radiation dose received by an astronaut on even the shortest 
        Earth-Mars round trip would be about 0.66 sievert. This amount is like receiving a whole-body CT scan every 
        five or six days” (Tate, 2013).
        
        One potential solution lies in genetic enhancement, a concept usually reserved for sci-fi novels and movies. 
        In an experiment, scientists inserted genes from tardigrades — “tiny, adorable and famously tough animals that 
        can survive the vacuum of space” — into human cells.  Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine, 
        cited that these cells “exhibited a greater resistance to radiation than their normal counterparts” (Wall, 2020). 
        This, along with space equipment, may eliminate the problem of space radiation forever, but future testing is 
        required for the safety and applicability of this discovery to a wide range of people. 
        
        In addition, on Mars, “water is present in the soil and can be made available to the settlement for hygiene, 
        drinking, and farming. It is also the source of oxygen generated through electrolysis” (“Mission Feasibility - 
        Mission”, n.d.). 
        
        With water, genetic enhancement, and some form of heating up Mars, the obstacles necessary to live on another 
        planet seem slim. However, adapting a planet to human needs takes time. There needs to be time for plants to 
        convert carbon dioxide to oxygen, time to convert water into oxygen through electrolysis, time to research and 
        apply genetic enhancement, and time to bring thousands or millions of colonists to Mars. 
        
        Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, claims that he’ll send a million people to Mars by 2050, a hopeful outlook for this 
        impossible mission. But nothing important is ever accomplished without obstacles, and space colonization is no different. 
        
        Let’s hope this mission succeeds before our time on Earth is no more.
